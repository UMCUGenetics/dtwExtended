# Multi-circular dynamic time warping alignment

## Introduction

In this repository you will find some rudimentary functions to be able to make multiple time-series alignments using dynamic timewarping. It requires the `dtw` package for the base implementation of pair-wise alignments. Here, we extend the pair-wise alignment to a multiple sequence alignment with a simplified version of the MUSCLE algorithm approach. Moreover, we also extend the possibility to make circular alignments.

## Dependencies

* `dtw`  (required)
* `ggplot2` (optional)
